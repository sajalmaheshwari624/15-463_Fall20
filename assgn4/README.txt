This is the README for the code for Assignment 4 of Computational Photography, Fall 2020.

DO NOT COMMENT ANY OF THE FUNCTIONS EXCEPT __init__. ALL THE COMMENTING/UNCOMMENTING SHOULD HAPPEN BETWEEN LINES 35 AND 68.
To run the code for the first question :
	1. Initials ->  Uncomment the lines 38 to 42. Comment the rest of the __init__ function.
	2. Sub-aperture views -> Uncomment the lines 38 to 46. Comment the rest of the __init__ function.
	3. Refocusing and focal stack generation -> Uncomment the lines 38 to 42.  Uncomment lines 49-51. Comment the rest of the __init__ function.
	4. AIF and depth map generation -> Uncomment the lines 38 to 42. Uncomment lines 49-52. Comment the rest of the __init__ function.
	5. Confocal depth map generation -> Uncomment the lines 38 to 42. Uncomment line 53. Comment the rest of the __init__ function.

To run the code for the second question : 
	1. Generate the focal stack by 
		Uncomment the lines 38 to 42.
		Uncomment lines 49-51
	2.  Generate the smart merged output images by uncommenting line 55 to 60.
	3. Rest of the code remains commented.

To run the code for the third question :
	1.  Uncomment lines 62-65. Rest entire __init__ function remains commented.

To run the code for the fourth question :
	1. Uncomment lines 67-69. Rest entire __init__ function remains commented.
