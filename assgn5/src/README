To run the different parts of the code :

Q1. 
	Initials - Run the initials function in main. The path is the path where the images are stored.
	Uncalibrated photometric stereo - Run the function uncalibrated. The QMatrix also needs to be given as the input and can be commented. Default QMatrix is Identity. 
	Simple rendering - Run the function render_image.
	Enforcing integrability - Run the function integrability
	Normal integration - Run the function integrate_normal
	Calibrated photometric - Only run the initials function and the calibrated_stereo_and_rest function. Comment all other functions in main

Q2. 
	Give the path of the images in the path variable.
	In the Initals function, choose the size of the box filter in the argument and the area to crop in the Initals function after reading the image (Line 38).

Q3. Run the code from line 290 to 292 after integration if normal.
